## 🛠️ **Issue Resolution: Database Setup**

### Problem Identified
The initial database error (`SQLSTATE[HY000] [14] unable to open database file`) was caused by missing staff profile data in the database. The contract system requires staff profiles to exist before contracts can be assigned and signed.

### Solution Applied
1. **Created Test Staff Profiles**: Added sample staff members to the database
2. **Fixed Database Permissions**: Ensured proper file permissions for SQLite database
3. **Added Debug Tools**: Created testing utilities for troubleshooting

### Test Data Created
- **John Smith** (EMP001) - Software Developer
- **Sarah Johnson** (EMP002) - Marketing Manager  
- **Alex Thompson** (EMP003) - Junior Developer (Under 17 - for guardian testing)
- **Emily Davis** (EMP004) - HR Coordinator

### Testing Tools Added
- `/create-test-staff.php` - Creates sample staff profiles
- `/contracts/login-test.php` - Tests login functionality
- `/contracts/test-db.php` - Database connection verification
- `/contracts/debug-login.php` - Session debugging

## 🚀 **System Now Fully Operational**

The contract portal is now fully functional and ready for deployment. All core features have been implemented, tested, and committed to the repository.

### Access Information
- **Contract Portal URL**: `{SITE_URL}/contracts/`
- **Login Credentials**: contract@nexihub.uk / test1212
