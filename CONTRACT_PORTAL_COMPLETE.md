- **Sarah Johnson** (EMP002) - Marketing Manager  
- **Alex Thompson** (EMP003) - Junior Developer (Under 17 - for guardian testing)
- **Emily Davis** (EMP004) - HR Coordinator

### Testing Tools Added
- `/create-test-staff.php` - Creates sample staff profiles
- `/contracts/login-test.php` - Tests login functionality
- `/contracts/test-db.php` - Database connection verification
- `/contracts/debug-login.php` - Session debugging
